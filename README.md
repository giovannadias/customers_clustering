# Customer's Clustering 🛒

This project was made with the [Customer Personality Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis) database. 

## 💡 Problem Statement
Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different types of customers.

With this project, the store will have groups os similar customers, which will help create better marketing and sales strategies to increase revenue.

## 🔍 Cicle 1: Metrics
I started by making a baseline model so that I could have some metrics to evaluate the model's performance over the cicles.
The metrics that where chosen for this project where:
- **WSS (Within-Cluster Sum of Square):** a small sum of squares indicates a more compact cluster - meaning that the observations are closer within a cluster.
- **SS (Silhouette Score):** evaluates the similiarity of the observations in a cluster (if its closer to 1, means that the points belongs to the clusters they have been assigin, otherwise, if its closer to -1, means that the points should belong to other cluster).
